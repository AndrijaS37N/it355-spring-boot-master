<h3>A second year university Spring Boot project:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Made for the IT355 Web Services II course</li>
  <li>Has a MySQL database</li>
  <li>All app view snapshots are collected in the <b>screen-shots</b> dir</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project boot + A short personal note:</h3>
<p>The development IDE is IntelliJ IDEA. In order to deploy this to localhost,
you need to start the Main.java class with a configured Tomcat Server ready to push the app to your
chosen browser. I've also added the sql file that you can use in your database manager to create and 
insert a couple of rows of info. Woo woo!</p>
